    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: November 28, 2024</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Summary:</strong> Heart Rate Monitor does not collect, store, or share any personal data. All measurements are stored locally on your device only.
    </div>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how Heart Rate Monitor ("we", "our", or "the app") handles information when you use our mobile application.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are committed to protecting your privacy. This app is designed to work entirely offline and does not collect or transmit any personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>Heart Rate Monitor does not collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal identification information</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
        <li>Usage analytics</li>
        <li>Health data to external servers</li>
        <li>Any data transmitted over the internet</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Camera Permission</h2>
    <p>
        The app requires camera permission solely to measure your heart rate using photoplethysmography (PPG) technology. The camera is used to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Detect light variations through your fingertip</li>
        <li>Calculate your heart rate based on blood flow patterns</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>No images or videos are captured, stored, or transmitted.</strong> The camera data is processed in real-time and immediately discarded after calculating your heart rate.
    </p>

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
        Your heart rate measurements are stored locally on your device in an internal database. This data:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Never leaves your device</li>
        <li>Is not accessible to other apps</li>
        <li>Is not backed up to cloud services by the app</li>
        <li>Can be deleted at any time using the "Clear All" feature in the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        This app does not use any third-party services, analytics, or advertising networks. There are no SDKs that collect or process your data.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        This app does not knowingly collect any information from children. The app is intended for general wellness purposes for users of all ages.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since all data remains on your device and is never transmitted, your information is protected by your device's built-in security features, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device encryption</li>
        <li>Screen lock protection</li>
        <li>App sandboxing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access:</strong> View all your measurements in the History screen</li>
        <li><strong>Delete:</strong> Remove individual measurements or clear all history</li>
        <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Your data stays on your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date.
    </p>

    <h2>Medical Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
        Heart Rate Monitor is intended for wellness and fitness purposes only. It is not a medical device and should not be used for medical diagnosis or treatment. Always consult a healthcare professional for medical advice.
